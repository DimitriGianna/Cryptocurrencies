# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They have asked for me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Results
After having analyzed the data, I found a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.
